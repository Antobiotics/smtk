# Env details
For this project we are experimenting with [pipenv](https://github.com/kennethreitz/pipenv) instead of using traditional `requirements.txt`

Steps:
* Fork the project
* Clone your fork & cd to base directory containing the `Pipfile`
* `pip install pipenv` (base python not a virtual env) if it is not installed already
* From the directory containing `Pipfile` run `pipenv install`
* To work
